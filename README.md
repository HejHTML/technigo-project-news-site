Deployed project:

Hi!

Includes the following elements:
-header
-a main news article
-a grid of smaller news articles

Using CSS Grid & Flexbox, some shadow added. Responsiv for smartphone, tablets and bigger sceens.

Tools, techniques, planning.
I followed instructions from Technigo, did a sketch of the site on paper, started with simple HTML and built from it. I looked over and over again at Technigos videos in the course and asked google for help to correct code when I forgot something or needed more tips and trix. I tested coloring in CSS bit by bit, made the design come to life. 
If I had more time I would make a sidebar and complete the site with pages behind the links. Now it only goes to other sites to show that my links work. I don't think my colors are super for people who's colorblind or has problems with seeing. I know you should not use red and orange and so on, but I played with it this time and I really like my orange and pink vegan snack site. :)
I would also put more recipes in if I felt I had more time, to show off the nice responsiveness of scaling up and down the grid-items. :) Since this is my first week of learning code and my last week of summer vacay I thought I could maybe stop here and be satisfyed with my creation. I leared so much my head hurts, and my back! Time for a run!
I hope this is good enough!

PS. Oh my! I pushed and pulled around this repo to get the right folders in GitHub. I was totally sweaty after finding a submodule in repo - chatgpt adviced me and calmed me down a bit by telling me it was not a big deal. But I want to make it right. Now all the right code and files are in place - locally and in GitHub. This was the biggest thing I've learnt in this project. 

Mvh, Emma
